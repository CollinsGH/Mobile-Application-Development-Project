# Mobile-App-Development
This project is for my 3rd year Mobile Application Development module in college.

### Brief
Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated Storage and at least one other sensor or service available on the devices. These include:

+ Accelerometer or Gyroscope
+ GPS (Location Based Services)
+ Sound
+ Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc)
+ Camera
+ Multi Touch Gesture Management

The UWP application should be well designed with a clear purpose and an answer to the question "why will the user open this app for a second time?". The application must also be submitted for certification on the Windows Store. However, the application does not need to pass certification in order to be considered for grading.

### Goals
The following is a list of goals I set myself for this project.

+ Fullfil the brief outlined above
+ Make a multilingual application
+ Only use Microsoft products
+ Successfully submit the application to the Windows Store

### Planning
For this project I decided to make a camera app. The possible features for this application include automatically captioning an image and displayng the photos on a map, where each photo was taken.

### Development

#### Camera
The camera aspect of this project required both the Camera and Microphone capabilities in the manifest file.

#### Map
I choose to use Bing Maps for the map aspect of this project. An application key was required to use Bing Maps.

#### Finding a free image tagging API

### Why will the user open this app for a second time?

### Conclusion
